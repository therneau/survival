\section{Person years}
The person years routine and the expected survival code are the
two parts of the survival package that make use of external
rate tables, of which the United States mortality tables \code{survexp.us}
and \code{survexp.usr} are examples contained in the package.
The arguments for pyears are
\begin{description}
  \item[formula] The model formula. The right hand side consists of grouping
    variables and is essentially identical to [[survfit]], the result of the
    model will be a table of results with dimensions determined from the 
    right hand variables.  The formula can include an optional [[ratetable]]
    directive; but this style has been superseded by the [[rmap]] argument.
  \item [data, weights, subset, na.action] as usual
  \item[rmap] an optional mapping for rate table variables, see more below.
  \item[ratetable] the population rate table to use as a reference.  This can
    either be a ratetable object or a previously fitted Cox model
  \item[scale] Scale the resulting output times, e.g., 365.25 to turn days into
    years.
  \item[expect] Should the output table include the expected number of 
    events, or the expected number of person-years of observation?
  \item[model, x, y] as usual
  \item[data.frame] if true the result is returned as a data frame, if false
    as a set of tables.
\end{description}

Start out with the standard model processing, which involves making a copy
of the input call, but keeping only the arguments we want.
We then process the special argument [[rmap]].  This is discussed in the
section on the [[survexp]] function so we need not repeat the 
explantation here.
<<pyears-setup>>=
expect <- match.arg(expect)
Call <- match.call()
    
# create a call to model.frame() that contains the formula (required)
#  and any other of the relevant optional arguments
# then evaluate it in the proper frame
indx <- match(c("formula", "data", "weights", "subset", "na.action"),
                  names(Call), nomatch=0) 
if (indx[1] ==0) stop(gettextf("'%s' argument is required", "formula"))
tform <- Call[c(1,indx)]  # only keep the arguments we wanted
tform[[1L]] <- quote(stats::model.frame)  # change the function called

Terms <- if(missing(data)) terms(formula)
         else              terms(formula, data=data)
if (any(attr(Terms, 'order') >1))
        stop("Pyears cannot have interaction terms")

if (!missing(rmap) || !missing(ratetable)) {
    has.ratetable <- TRUE
    if (missing(ratetable)) stop("No rate table specified")
    <<survexp-setup-rmap>>
    }
else has.ratetable <- FALSE

mf <- eval(tform, parent.frame())

Y <- model.extract(mf, 'response')
if (is.null(Y)) stop("Follow-up time must appear in the formula")
if (!is.Surv(Y)){
    if (any(Y <0)) stop("Negative follow up time")
    Y <- as.matrix(Y)
    if (ncol(Y) >2) stop("Y has too many columns")
    }
else {
    stype <- attr(Y, 'type')
    if (stype == 'right') {
        if (any(Y[,1] <0)) stop("Negative survival time")
        nzero <- sum(Y[,1]==0 & Y[,2] ==1)
        if (nzero >0) 
                warning(sprintf(ngettext(nzero,
                         "%d observation with an event and 0 follow-up time, any rate calculations are statistically questionable",
                         "%d observations with an event and 0 follow-up time, any rate calculations are statistically questionable",
                          domain = "R-survival"), nzero), domain = NA)
        }
    else if (stype != 'counting')
        stop("Only right-censored and counting process survival types are supported")
    }

n <- nrow(Y)
if (is.null(n) || n==0) stop("Data set has 0 observations")

weights <- model.extract(mf, 'weights')
if (is.null(weights)) weights <- rep(1.0, n)
@ 

The next step is to check out the ratetable. 
For a population rate table a set of consistency checks is done by the
[[match.ratetable]] function, giving a set of sanitized indices [[R]].
This function wants characters turned to factors.
For a Cox model [[R]] will be a model matix whose covariates are coded
in exactly the same way that variables were coded in the original
Cox model.  We call the model.matrix.coxph function so as not to have to
repeat the steps found there (remove cluster statements, etc).   
<<pyears-setup>>=
# rdata contains the variables matching the ratetable
if (has.ratetable) {
    rdata <- data.frame(eval(rcall, mf), stringsAsFactors=TRUE)  
    if (is.ratetable(ratetable)) {
        israte <- TRUE
        rtemp <- match.ratetable(rdata, ratetable)
        R <- rtemp$R
        }
    else if (inherits(ratetable, 'coxph') && !inherits(ratetable, "coxphms")) {
        israte <- FALSE
        Terms <- ratetable$terms
        if (!is.null(attr(Terms, 'offset')))
            stop("Cannot deal with models that contain an offset")
        strats <- attr(Terms, "specials")$strata
        if (length(strats))
            stop("pyears cannot handle stratified Cox models")

        R <- model.matrix.coxph(ratetable, data=rdata)
        }
    else stop("Invalid ratetable")
    }
@ 

Now we process the non-ratetable variables. 
Those of class [[tcut]] set up time-dependent classes.  For
these the cutpoints attribute sets the intervals, if there
were 4 cutpoints of 1, 5,6, and 10 the 3 intervals will be 1-5,
5-6 and 6-10, and odims will be 3.
All other variables are treated as factors.
<<pyears-setup>>= 
ovars <- attr(Terms, 'term.labels')
if (length(ovars)==0)  {
    # no categories!
    X <- rep(1,n)
    ofac <- odim <- odims <- ocut <- 1
    }
else {
    odim <- length(ovars)
    ocut <- NULL
    odims <- ofac <- double(odim)
    X <- matrix(0, n, odim)
    outdname <- vector("list", odim)
    names(outdname) <- attr(Terms, 'term.labels')
    for (i in 1:odim) {
        temp <- mf[[ovars[i]]]
        if (inherits(temp, 'tcut')) {
            X[,i] <- temp
            temp2 <- attr(temp, 'cutpoints')
            odims[i] <- length(temp2) -1
            ocut <- c(ocut, temp2)
            ofac[i] <- 0
            outdname[[i]] <- attr(temp, 'labels')
    	}
        else {
            temp2 <- as.factor(temp)
            X[,i] <- temp2
            temp3 <- levels(temp2)
            odims[i] <- length(temp3)
            ofac[i] <- 1
            outdname[[i]] <- temp3
    	}
    }
}
@

Now do the computations.  
The code above has separated out the variables into 3 groups:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The variables in the rate table.  These determine where we 
    \emph{start} in the rate table with respect to retrieving the relevant
    death rates.  For the US table [[survexp.us]] this will be the date of
    study entry, age (in days) at study entry, and sex of each subject.
  \item The variables on the right hand side of the model.  These are 
    interpreted almost identically to a call to [[table]], with special
    treatment for those of class \emph{tcut}.
  \item The response variable, which tells the number of days of follow-up
    and optionally the status at the end of follow-up.
\end{itemize}

Start with the rate table variables. 
There is an oddity about US rate tables: the entry for age (year=1970,
age=55) contains the daily rate for anyone who turns 55 in that year,
from their birthday forward for 365 days.  So if your birthday is on
Oct 2, the 1970 table applies from 2Oct 1970 to 1Oct 1971.  The
underlying C code wants to make the 1970 rate table apply from 1Jan
1970 to 31Dec 1970.  The easiest way to finess this is to fudge
everyone's enter-the-study date.  If you were born in March but
entered in April, make it look like you entered in Febuary; that way
you get the first 11 months at the entry year's rates, etc.  The birth
date is entry date - age in days (based on 1/1/1970).

The other aspect of the rate tables is that ``older style'' tables, those that
have the factor attribute, contained only decennial data which the C code would
interpolate on the fly.  The value of [[atts$factor]] was 10 indicating that
there are 10 years in the interpolation interval.  The newer tables do not
do this and the C code is passed a 0/1 for continuous (age and year) versus
discrete (sex, race).

(This is set up as a separate file in the source code directory since
it is easier to make the code stay in C-mode if the file has a .nw 
extension.)

First define a function that allocates a ragged array.  The code has 
many matrices, and it is easier to use \verb!x[i][j]! notation
for them.
<<survfitci>>=
#include "survS.h"

<<survfitci-dmatrix>>
SEXP survfitci(SEXP ftime2,  SEXP sort12,  SEXP sort22, SEXP ntime2,
                    SEXP status2, SEXP cstate2, SEXP wt2,  SEXP id2,
                    SEXP p2,  SEXP sefit2) {

Arguments to the routine are the following.
For an R object ``zed'' I use the convention of [[zed2]] to refer to the
object and [[zed]] to the contents of the object.
\begin{description}
  \item[ftime] A two column matrix containing the entry and exit times
    for each subject.
  \item[sort1] Order vector for the entry times.  The first element of sort1
    points to the first entry time, etc.
  \item[sort2] Order vector for the event times.
  \item[ntime] Number of unique event time values.  This fixes the size of
    the output arrays.
  \item[status] Status for each observation.  0= censored
  \item[cstate] The initial state for each subject, which will be
    updated during computation to always be the current state.
  \item[wt] Case weight for each observation.
  \item[id] The subject id for each observation.
  \item[p] The initial distribution of states.  This will be updated during
    computation to be the current distribution.
  \item[sefit] If 1 then do the se compuatation, otherwise forget it.
\end{description}

The local dmatrix2 function makes it easier to declare ragged arrays,
which allows for the nice \verb!x[i][j]! notation for arrays.
<<survfitci-dmatrix>>=
/* allocate a ragged array of a given number of rows and columns */
static double **dmatrix2(int nrow, int ncol) {
    int i;
    double **mat;
    double *d;

    mat = (double **) R_alloc(nrow, sizeof(double *));
    d   = (double *) R_alloc(nrow*ncol, sizeof(double));
    for (i=0; i<nrow; i++) {
        mat[i] = d;
        d += ncol;
        }
    return(mat);
    }
@        

Declare all of the variables.

The primary loop of the program walks along the [[sort2]]
vector, with one pass through the loop for each unique
event time.  
Observations are at risk in the interval (entry, event], note
the round and square brackets, so we need [[entry < ctime <= event]],
where [[ctime]] is the unique event time of current interest.
The basic loop is to add new subjects to the risk set, compute,
save results, then remove expired ones from the risk set.
then remove old one.
The [[ns]] and [[ws]] vectors keep track of the number of subjects
currently in eachs state and the weighted number currently in each
state.  
There are four indexing patterns in play which may be confusing.
\begin{itemize}
  \item The output matrices, which index by unique event time [[itime]]
  \item The [[n]] observations (variables entry, event, sort1, sort2, status,
    wt, id)
  \item The [[nperson]] individual subjects (variables cstate, atrisk)
  \item The [[nstate]] states (variables hmat, p)
\end{itemize}

The key variables for the computation are the matrix $H$ and the
current prevalence vector $P$.
$H$ is created anew at each unique time point.
Row $j$ of $H$ concerns everyone in state $j$ just before the time point,
and contains the transitions at that time point.
So the $jk$ element is the (weighted) fraction who change from state $j$
to state $k$, and the $jj$ element the fraction who stay put.
Each row of $H$ by definition sums to 1.  
If no one is in the state the $jj$ element is set to 1.
A second version which we call H2 has 1 subtracted from each diagonal and so
that the row sums are 0, we go back and
forth depending on which is needed at the moment.
If there are no events at this time point $P$ and $U$ do not update.

@ 

The most complicated part of the code is the update of the
per subject influence matrix $U$, which has nperson rows and
nstate columns.  It has 3 steps.
Refer to equation \eqref{ci2} for the mathematical details.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The entire matrix is multiplied by $H$.
  \item Consider the scaled matrix J whose $k$th row is the
    matrix H2 scaled by the value p[k]/ws[k]. (Probability of being
    in the state divided by the weighted number in the state).
    If subject $i$ is currently at risk and currently in state $k$,
    then row $k$ of $J$ is subtracted from U[i,].
  \item For each subject $i$ who had an event at this time and went
    from state $j$ to state $k$, U[i,j] will decrease by p[j]/ws[j]
    and U[i,k] will increase by the same amount.
\end{enumerate}
If standard errors are not needed we can skip this calculation, which
speeds up the code considerably.

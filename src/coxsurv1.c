/*
** Survival curves for a Cox model.  This routine counts up all
**  the totals that we need. The number at risk is a PITA in R code, but all
**  the rest of the compuations are simple there.  This creates more totals
**  than we currenly use, as an attempt to future proof the code.
**
** coxsurv1: (time,status) for multistate
** coxsurv2: (time1, time2, status) for multistate
** coxsurv3: (time, status) for single state
** coxsurv4: (time1, time2, status) for single state
**
** The routine uses a stacked input data set, one 'layer' per transition,
**  and outputs values for each transition, at each of the prespecified time
**  points. In a multistate model we need the values for all strata,
**  even if there was no event in some particular transtition at that time
**  point.  When there are extranal strata in the model, e.g.,
**  coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ age + strata(inst), lung), then this
**  routine will be called separatedly for individual strata, with otime the
**  event times in that stratum.  Ditto for a multistate model that had
**  external strata.
**
**  otime:  vector of output times.  All the transitions will get reports at
**            these time points.  This fcn is called for all of the
**            transitions at once, sorted by transition,
**            but called separately for any strata() groups.
**  y   :    survival response, two column
**  weight:  observation weight
**  sort2: sort index for the survival time
**  trans:   the data set is stacked: all the data for transition 1, then
**            transition 2, etc for a multi-state model (th
**  xmat2:   covariates
**  risk2:   risk score
**
**  output: A matrix of counts, with one row per time, per stratum, and
**           matrices with xbar for those at risk, and the sum of x for
**	     terminal events at the current time.
**
**  For the weighted counts, number at risk != entries - exits.  Someone with
**    a sequence of (1,2)(2,5)(5,6) will have 1 entry and 1 exit, but they might
**    have 3 changes of risk score due to time-dependent covariates.
**  n0-3 has to count all the changes, while n8-n9 (only used in printout)
**    keep track of the final exit, and 3-7 and 10-11 refer only to a given
**    timepoint.
**
**  Let w1=1, w2= wt, w3= wt*risk.  The counts n[] are
**   0-2: number at risk: w1, w2, w3
**   3-5: events: w1, w2, w3
**   6-7: censored: w1,w2
**   8-9: Efron number at risk
